             <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This soup is from a recipe book for kids, purportedly with three or less ingredients and steps. They do not count water as an ingredient. </p>
                <p>Careful not to add too much honey, otherwise it's just unpleasant. You want savory! Unless you're looking for a sweet soup, then do whatever.</p>
                <p>Produces one serving.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2/3 cup Tomato Sauce</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsps Heavy Cream</li>
                    <li>2 tsps Honey</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup Water</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put all ingredients in a small saucepan. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Bring just to a boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.</li>
                    <li>When nice and hot, pour into a mug. Let cool a bit and drink away. (Or use a spoon.)</li>
                </ol>
