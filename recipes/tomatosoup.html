             <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
                <p class="description">This soup is from a recipe book for kids, purportedly with three or less ingredients and steps. They do not count water as an ingredient. </p>
                <p class="description">Careful not to add too much honey, otherwise it's just unpleasant. You want savory! Unless you're looking for a sweet soup, then do whatever.</p>
                <p class="description">Produces one serving.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2/3 cup Tomato Sauce</li>
